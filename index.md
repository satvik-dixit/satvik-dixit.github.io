I am a masters student at Carnegie Mellon University. I work with Professor [Bhiksha Raj](https://cmu-mlsp.github.io/team/bhiksha_raj) on speech processing. I am mainly interested in deep learning, speech and LLMs. 

Previously, I was working at MIT in the Sensible Intelligence Group on the explainability of SSL embeddings. I studied EE at IIT Delhi where I focussed on learning about signals and ML.
