I am a master's student at Carnegie Mellon University. I work with Professor [Bhiksha Raj](https://cmu-mlsp.github.io/team/bhiksha_raj) on Speech Processing and Audio Language Models, and Professor [Chris Donahue](https://chrisdonahue.com/) on Text-to-Audio Models. My research interests focus on speech/audio processing and LLMs.

Previously, I worked at MIT with Professor [Satrajit Ghosh](https://sensein.group/) on the explainability of self-supervised learning (SSL) embeddings, such as WavLM, for speech emotion recognition. I have also worked at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lcav/people/martin-vetterli/) on room acoustics simulation. I completed my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering at IIT Delhi, where my concentration was on signals and ML. My undergraduate thesis was on the classification of neuron types based on EEG signals.
